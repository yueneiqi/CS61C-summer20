   ## CS61C : Great ideas in Computer architecture

This repository contains all my learning resources for CS61C. I use the 2020 summer version because it open-sourced the lecture videos. You can watch the videos either on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoI-XvXO0aqgoMQvogzmf7CKiSMSUS3M) or [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fC4y147iZ?from=search&seid=1039011700066128636).

Here is the [course website](https://cs61c.org/su20/), you can find all the materials on it.

repository structure is as follows :

- Handouts: some additional reading materials, including some openMP learning materials
- Slides: course slides
- Discussions: TA discussion pdf and answers
- Labs
- Projects

---

This course puts all its labs on [a seperate repository](https://github.com/61c-teach/su20-lab-starter). I merge it into `labs` folder.

- Labs: contains 11 labs
  - [ ] Lab01: C basics
  - [ ] Lab02: Advanced C

  - [ ] Lab03: RISC-V basics  
  - [ ] Lab04: RISC-V functions
  - [ ] Lab05: Logism
  - [ ] Lab06: CPU & pipling
  - [ ] Lab07: caches
  - [ ] Lab08: virtual memory
  - [ ] Lab09: SIMD
  - [ ] Lab10: openMP
  - [ ] Lab11: Spark

The projects I chose the 2020 fall version, which is a little different than the 2020 summer version. You can use the "Semesters" button on the up-right of the website page to choose the semester.

- Projects: I did five projects, each project is a independent repository, the links below will redirect to the repository which contains my implementation.

  - [ ] Fa19-Project1: Mandelbrot

  - [ ] Fa20-Project1: game-of-life
  - [ ] Fa20-project2: classify
  - [ ] Fa20-project3: CPU
  - [ ] Fa20-project4: numc
